# Hash Game

- A simple hash game to practice front and back end development, still in progress

## Next steps

1. Back end must save the host's symbol. As it is now, only the turn's symbol is saved.
2. Front end must show the symbols of each participant in the game. 

## TO DO

- Change data from TXT to JSON files
- Use a data bank. This solution can be tested in another branch
- Add a password to the players
- Insert a field of opponent and the option of create a new player if an opponent is not yet a saved player
- Insert favicon
- Insert meta SEO: charset, viewport, author, description, robots...
- Insert confirmation step when deleting a player
- Insert functions to check when the game ends (afterwards put them in a separeted module)
- Use forms to receive players's input (it is being teste in another branch)
